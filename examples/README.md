## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

### ðŸ”µ `EEG_AD_FTD/`  
Scripts to generate results from applying our inverse models to the EEG dataset used in the study. This dataset 
includes both healthy controls (HCs) and patients clinically diagnosed with Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) at varying stages: 
mild (ADMIL), moderate (ADMOD), and severe (ADSEV).

**Note**: This EEG dataset is not publicly available but can be provided by the authors upon reasonable 
  request.

- **`EEG_AD_FTD.py`**:  
  Extracts empirical features from EEG data and computes predictions of changes in cortical circuit parameters in 
patients with dementia due to AD
- **`figures/EEG_predictions.py`**:  
    Generates **Figure 7**: *"Predicted circuit parameter imbalances in AD based on EEG data"*

### ðŸ”µ `LFP_developing_brain/`  
Scripts to generate results of applying our inverse models to resting-state LFP recordings from the prefrontal 
cortex (PFC) of unanesthetized mice during early postnatal development.  

- **`LFP_developing_brain.py`**:  
  Extracts empirical features from developmental LFP data and computes predictions of changes in cortical circuit 
parameters during the early postnatal period.

- **`figures/LFP_predictions.py`**:  
  Generates **Figure 6**: *"Predictions of changes in cortical circuit parameters derived from developmental 
LFP data."*

- **`figures/emp_features.py`**: 
    Plots features extracted from LFP data as a function of postnatal days.

**Note**: `figures/LFP_predictions.py` performs a Linear Mixed-Effects (LME) analysis, which requires both R and the Python `rpy2` 
packages to be installed beforehand. In the R environment, the following packages must also be installed:


  - `lme4`  
  - `emmeans`

  You can install them with conda using:
  ```bash
  conda install -c conda-forge r-base rpy2 r-lme4 r-emmeans
  ```

  To just install the R packages, use:

  ```r
  install.packages("lme4", dependencies = TRUE)
  install.packages("emmeans", dependencies = TRUE)
  ```

  If you prefer not to use the LME analysis, you can opt to compute Cohen's d statistic instead, which does not 
  require R.


### ðŸ”µ `simulation/`

> **Note:** To run examples that include simulations of the LIF network model (e.g., in `example_full_pipeline.py`), 
> the [NEST simulator](https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io/) must be installed.  
> If you're using Conda or Docker, you can install a pre-built NEST package with:
>
> ```bash
> conda install -c conda-forge nest-simulator=3.8
> ```
>
> Similarly, to compute field potentials, the [`LFPykernels`](https://github.com/LFPy/LFPykernels) package must be installed via pip:
>
> ```bash
> pip install LFPykernels
> ```


#### Figures Generation (`Hagen_model/figures/`)

- **`example_full_pipeline.py`**  
  Generates plots for **Figure 3**: *"Representative simulations illustrating the dynamics of the LIF network model in 
response to varying external input values."*

- **`save_code_as_image.py`**  
  Generates **Figure 2**: *"A Python code snippet demonstrating the usage of the `ncpi` library and its core classes."*

- **`SBI_results.py`**  
  Generates plots using SBI-based models (**Supplementary Material**).

- **`sim_features.py`**  
  Generates **Figure 4**: *"Comparison of features extracted from simulated neural signals."*

- **`sim_predictions.py`**  
  Generates **Figure 5**: *"Predicted model parameters based on simulation data under various feature configurations."*

---

#### Simulation Code (`Hagen_model/simulation/`)

- **`params/`**  
  Contains parameter sets used to run simulations of Hagen's model.

- **`python/`**  
  Contains the main Python script to execute Hagenâ€™s model simulations.

- **`compute_features.py`**  
  Extracts features from simulated data.

- **`example_model_simulation.py`**  
  Example script demonstrating how to simulate Hagenâ€™s model.

- **`preprocessing.py`**  
  Preprocesses simulated data and structures it appropriately before feature extraction.

- **`sim_statistics.py`**  
  Plots statistical relationships between model parameters and extracted features.

---

#### Model Training (`Hagen_model/train/`)

- **`RepeatedKFold.py`**  
  Trains inverse models on simulation data using repeated K-fold cross-validation.
