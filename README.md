[Getting Started](https://necolab-ugr.github.io/ncpi/tutorials/getting_started.html) | [Documentation](https://necolab-ugr.github.io/ncpi/)

`ncpi` is a Python package for model-based inference of neural circuit parameters from population-level 
electrophysiological recordings, such as LFP, ECoG, MEG, and EEG. `ncpi` provides a rapid, reproducible, and robust 
framework for estimating the most probable neural circuit parameters associated with an empirical observation, 
streamlining traditionally complex workflows into a minimal amount of code. Check out the [example usage](#example-usage) 
to see how `ncpi` can accelerate your research and unlock the full potential of **model-based neural inference**.

# Key Features of `ncpi`
- **All-in-one solution**: Streamline your workflow with a unified package that integrates state-of-the-art methods for
both forward and inverse modeling of extracellular signals based on single-neuron network model simulations. `ncpi` 
integrates tools to simulate realistic population-level neural signals, extract key neurophysiological features, 
train inverse modeling approaches, predict circuit parameters, and ultimately benchmark candidate biomarkers, or 
sets of biomarkers, as proxy markers of neural circuit dynamics.

- **Biophysically grounded analysis**: Effortlessly decode experimental electrophysiological recordings using robust, 
reproducible, and streamlined code—unlocking model-based biophysical insights in just a few lines.

- **Flexible and extensible**: Seamlessly integrate ncpi into your workflow—use individual functionalities (e.g.,
parameter inference techniques based on [sbi](https://sbi-dev.github.io/sbi)) with custom functions or deploy the full 
inverse modelling pipeline. Designed for modularity, it adapts to your needs without constraints.


# Installation

`ncpi` requires Python 3.10 or higher. To install `ncpi`, you can use pip. The package is available on PyPI, so you can 
install it directly from there.

```bash
# Step 1: Create and activate a conda environment (recommended)
conda create -n ncpi-env python=3.10 -y
conda activate ncpi-env

# Step 2: Install ncpi using pip
pip install ncpi
```

# Folder Structure

- `ncpi/`: Contains the source code for the library, organized into modules and classes.
- `examples/`: Includes scripts used to reproduce the results presented in the reference papers (see [Citation](#Citation)).
- `docs/`: Contains documentation for the library, including usage instructions, API references, and guides.
- `img/`: Stores image assets for the project, such as the library logo.


# Example Usage
```python
import ncpi
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Parameters for generating simulated neural data
n_neurons = 50           # Number of neurons in each simulated recording
sim_time = 2000          # Total number of time points per sample 
sampling_rate = 100      # Sampling rate in Hz
n_samples = 1000        # Total number of samples (combined training + test set)

# Preallocate arrays for storing simulation output
sim_data = {
    'X': np.zeros((n_samples, int((sim_time + sampling_rate - 1) / sampling_rate))), 
    'θ': np.zeros((n_samples, 1))
}

def simulator(θ):
    """
    Simulates spike trains modulated by a synaptic-like process.
    
    This function generates synthetic neural spike trains by first creating
    a random input signal for each neuron and convolving it with an exponential
    kernel that mimics synaptic dynamics. The result is a smooth, temporally 
    correlated signal interpreted as the probability of spiking at each time step.

    Parameters
    ----------
    θ : float
        Controls the exponential decay of the synaptic kernel.

    Returns
    -------
    spikes : ndarray of shape (n_neurons, sim_time)
        Binary array representing spikes (1s) and no spikes (0s) for each neuron over time.
